# tabultr
A simple and small javascript library that quickly renders json data onto a HTML5 table. It is useful when trying to quickly peak at your data before deciding how you intend to render them.
# Express Integration
The library can also be integrated as a middleware with an express application where it would be able to fetch data from a mongoDB database. (Feature still under development)
